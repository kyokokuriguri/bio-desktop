<h2><p><center>sometimes i wonder why i cant sleep some nights. is it becuse my adhd is making my mind race? or isit becuse i miss them? some nights i cant tell
some nights i sleep ot get rid of all the bullshit ive herd and seen throgh out the day.but one thing never leavs my mind no mater how hard i try. are they ok? 
it seems like a silly question to ask, but it never leavs. it jsut sits in the back of my mind. i have to reasue myself that they are ok. seeing them makes that qestion go away
entierly for some reason. but why? even i cant tell why. i think it might be atattchemnt issues. i may have become too clingy.
